#summary Explanation/Promotion of AS2Box, our Managed AS2 Gateway

You *have to* exchange files/message using *AS2* with your trading partner *tomorrow*, and you do not know the AS2 (RFC 4130) transport protocol. On the other hand, you have experience transferring files/messages with *FTP* or *HTTP* (WebDAV). Then, *AS2Box* is the solution to your problem!

An AS2Box is a simple *folder structure* with an "incoming" and an "outgoing" folders, which you can access via FTP or WebDAV.

We *manage* the AS2 connectivity with your *trading partners*.

The messages that your trading partner sent to your AS2Box will go into your "incoming" folder, while the messages you upload to your "outgoing" folder will be picked up and sent to your trading partner.

You can directly go to [http://www.as2box.net/signup.html http://www.as2box.net/signup.html] and fill the registration/configuration form, or send me an e-mail to [mailto:babelabout@gmail.com babelabout@gmail.com] if you have any questions/remarks.
